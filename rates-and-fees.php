                <p>Only a lender or lending partner can provide you with information on their rates and terms. This will
                    typically happen shortly after your loan request is complete, and you are connected with a lender or
                    lending partner. DollarLoanHub does not make credit decisions or determine rates and terms.
                    Remember, you are under no obligation to accept the loan offer if the terms are not satisfactory for
                    whatever reason.</p>
                <h3>Repayment</h3>
                <p>Repayment on personal loans is generally performed either monthly or once every two weeks, depending
                    either on your preferences or your lender's or lending partner’s terms. You may be able to have
                    funds withdrawn automatically from your bank account on the date agreed upon with your lender or
                    lending partner. Be sure that you read and fully understand all policies regarding repayment and
                    understand what you will have to do as a borrower to repay the loan. Your loan cannot be conditioned
                    upon repayment by electronic funds transfer or automatic withdrawal. Consult your lender or lending
                    partner for more details.</p>
                <h3>Personal Loan Costs</h3>
                <p>On the whole, the eventual cost of a personal loan will vary a great deal based on factors related to
                    the requester, the state the requester lives in, the lender or lending partner, and the requester's
                    repayment. Other factors that matter are the amount of money that is borrowed, the period of time of
                    the loan and the specific interest rates used. Your credit score may also be taken into
                    consideration.</p>
                <h3>Standard Personal Loan Terms</h3>
                <p>While specific terms of personal loans will vary depending on your state, your lender or lending
                    partner and your specific circumstances, below is a general range of common terms.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Loan amount: $500 – $35,000</li>
                    <li>Lending period: 60 days - 72 months</li>
                    <li>Payment frequency: Once a month or twice a month</li>
                    <li>APR: Will vary based on your credit score, repayment history and other factors.</li>
                    <li>Prepayment penalty: Varies by Lender</li>
                </ol>
