                <p>DollarLoanHub works hard to protect consumers like you from unfair and illegal practices in the
                    personal loan industry. In an effort to assist us in this goal of protecting you and helping you
                    make an informed decision regarding personal loans, we offer the following code of conduct.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We make sure that all of our customers are well informed about the process of borrowing money,
                        about their responsibilities as borrowers and about the repercussions of failing to pay money
                        back on time.</li>
                    <li>We provide clear and transparent information to our customers and treat them with courtesy and
                        respect.</li>
                    <li>We hold ourselves to a high standard of service and customer satisfaction.</li>
                    <li>We ensure that each lender or lending partner we work with is reputable and follows responsible
                        lending practices.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Lenders and Lending Partners</h3>
                <p>Here at DollarLoanHub, we make every effort to ensure that we work only with responsible lenders or
                    lending partners who are authorized to lend cash to consumers in the form of personal / installment
                    loans. Once you are connected with your lender or lending partner, we recommend that you look up the
                    specific details on that company so that you know how to get in contact with them in case you have
                    any questions or concerns. Each lender or lending partner also has their own terms and conditions in
                    regards to interest rates, the requirements on repayment and the repercussions of being late on a
                    payment, missing a payment or rolling over a payment. You should be sure to be aware of these
                    specific terms and conditions.</p>
                <h3>Your Credit Score</h3>
                <p>One of the first and most important things to understand as a borrower is that being late on a
                    payment, missing a payment or rolling over a payment may negatively impact your credit score. Your
                    credit score is a numerical expression of your credit worthiness based on an analysis of your credit
                    files. A credit score is primarily based on credit report information typically sourced from credit
                    bureaus. Failing to pay on time may negatively affect this score and make it harder for you to do
                    things like take out a credit card or get a loan. While less than perfect credit will not
                    necessarily prevent you from being able to receive a loan, all loans are subject to credit approval.
                    As such, the lender or lending partner that you are connected with may run a credit check with one
                    or more credit agency. If you have had many credit checks in a given period of time, it is possible
                    that this check may negatively affect your credit score. But, if you are able to make all of your
                    payments on time, the process of taking out and repaying a loan may improve your credit score.</p>
                <h3>Late Payments</h3>
                <p>The most important thing that you must understand as a borrower is the repercussions of making late
                    payments on your loan. Although each lender or lending partner that we work with has its own terms
                    and conditions for the loan and the repayment of the loan, there are some general repercussions that
                    it is important for you to understand. There will likely be charges for making a late payment.
                    Similarly, if you are extending a loan, the finance charge for the original loan must be paid on the
                    original due date. Then your loan principal will be deferred with an additional finance charge. We
                    recommend paying as much as possible towards your original due date in order to further reduce the
                    charges you incur. If you plan to deviate from your payment plan, you should contact your lender or
                    lending partner immediately to setup a new payment arrangement. If your loan payment is rejected for
                    any reason by your bank, the lender or lending partner may initiate collection procedures and you
                    will be prevented from receiving future loans from the lender or lending partner until all of your
                    payment obligations are met in full. The most important thing to remember is to read about the
                    payment options and penalties for the specific lender or lending partner that you are connected with
                    and to make sure that you fully understand these policies. Lastly, remember that personal loans
                    should be used only for short-term financial needs. They are not a long-term financial solution. In
                    general you should always make sure to pay all of your outstanding loans/bills/debts on time.</p>
                <h3>Missing a Payment</h3>
                <p>DollarLoanHub strongly recommends that you pay all of your outstanding debt/loans/bills when they are
                    due. This will ensure that you will have a good payment record and minimize negative repercussions.
                    Each lender or lending partner that DollarLoanHub works with has their own terms and conditions
                    governing the specific implications of missing a payment. However, if the lender or lending partner
                    does not receive a payment the likely result is that the lender or lending partner will begin
                    collection procedures against you and you will no longer be able to receive any more loans from the
                    lender or lending partner. Therefore, it is important for you to both understand the specific
                    requirements for repayment and the repercussions of missing a payment. And, again we strongly urge
                    you to pay all outstanding debts/loans/bills on time.</p>

                <h3>Rolling Over a Payment</h3>
                <p>With some lenders or lending partners, it may be possible to roll over payments if you are unable to
                    make a payment date. However, please note that, just like missing a payment or being late on a
                    payment, this will have a negative effect on your credit score. Also, it is important to know that
                    the interest that you pay will be the same with the rolled-over payment as with the missed payment.
                </p>
                <h3>Types of Renewal Policies</h3>
                <p>DollarLoanHub works with a number of different lenders and lending partners, each of which has its
                    own unique renewal policy. However, as a general rule there are two different kinds of renewals:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Unlimited renewals. These allow you to continuously renew and are the most risky for borrowers.
                    </li>
                    <li>Automatic and borrower-initiated renewals. These forms of renewals are not unlimited and are
                        subject to time limits.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Collection</h3>
                <p>If you miss a payment on your loan and do not contact the lender or lending partner to discuss other
                    repayment options, it is likely that your loan will be subject to collections. You will normally be
                    contacted via phone, email and regular mail. If you continue to not respond, they will most likely
                    use an external collections agency to collect the debt. These specifics will vary by the specific
                    lender or lending partner, so it is important that you be sure to read and understand your specific
                    loan’s terms and conditions. You may be able to have funds withdrawn automatically from your bank
                    account on the date agreed upon with your lender or lending partner. Be sure that you read and fully
                    understand all of your lender or lending partner's policies regarding repayment and understand what
                    you will have to do as a borrower to repay the loan. Your loan can not be conditioned upon repayment
                    by electronic funds transfer or automatic withdrawal. Consult your lender or lending partner for
                    more details.</p>
