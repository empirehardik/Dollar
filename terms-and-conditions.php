                <h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
                <h3>Loan Referral Service</h3>
                <p>Our loan referral service (the “<strong>Service</strong>”) connects consumers with prospective
                    lenders participating in
                    our network (the “<strong>Lender Partners</strong>”). To use the Service, you must complete an
                    online request form (a
                    “<strong>Request Form</strong>”) that requests personal information from you, including your name,
                    address, telephone
                    number, email address, social security number, bank account information, and employment information.
                    Please review our privacy policy at <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> (“Privacy
                    Policy”). The terms of the Privacy Policy
                    are incorporated into and considered a part of these Terms of Use.</p>
                <h3>Credit Decisions</h3>
                <p>DollarLoanHub.com is not a lender and does not make loans or credit decisions.</p>
                <p>DollarLoanHub.com does not guarantee that any Lender Partner will offer you a loan or that any loan
                    offer will contain any specific loan terms or conditions. DollarLoanHub.com does not guarantee that
                    the price, product, availability, rates, fees, or any other loan terms offered and made available by
                    Lender Partners through the Service are the best terms available in the market.</p>
                <p>Once you submit a Request Form, DollarLoanHub.com shares your information with our Lender Partners.
                    By submitting a Request Form, you understand and agree that you requesting loan offers from the
                    Lender Partners. You are also agreeing that DollarLoanHub.com and the Lender Partners may contact
                    you by any means (including email, telephone, SMS, and direct mail) so that they may assist in
                    processing your Request Form or provide information to you about additional offers now or in the
                    future.</p>
                <p>Lender Partners who receive your Request Form review your information in real-time to determine
                    whether your information meets the Lender Partner’s underwriting criteria. Lender Partners may use
                    your Request Form information to perform a credit check. This credit check may be a formal credit
                    inquiry which leaves a record on your credit report and may affect your credit score (a
                    “<strong>Hard
                        Check</strong> ”). Or it could be an informal inquiry which will not affect your credit (a
                    “<strong>Soft Check</strong>”).
                    These credit checks may be performed through TransUnion, Equifax, or Experian (the “<strong>Big
                        Three</strong>”) or
                    they may be performed through other alternative credit reporting agencies or data aggregators (such
                    as Microbilt, Teletrack, DP Bureau, or DataX) that track consumer transactions with lending
                    institutions. By submitting your Request Form, you agree to allow Lender Partners to review, verify,
                    and research your information in such a manner.</p>
                <p>If a Lender Partner determines that your Request Form meets its underwriting criteria, your browser
                    will be redirected to the lender’s website. You understand and agree that, once you have been
                    redirected to the lender’s website, DollarLoanHub.com has no further involvement in the loan
                    registration or decision process. Your interactions with the lender are subject to privacy policy,
                    terms of use, and other policies or terms enforced by that lender.</p>
                <h3>Electronic Disclosure</h3>
                <p>By Submitting your Request Form you agree to receive notifications, disclosures, and other documents
                    and communications both from DollarLoanHub.com and from our Lender Partners. If you are connected to
                    a Lender Partner, that lender may require you to execute an electronic loan contract. This
                    electronic loan contract will be as binding as a loan contract in paper form. And your electronic
                    signature will be as valid as a physical signature on a paper loan contract.</p>
                <p>The lender may also require you to consent to receiving all notifications regarding your loan
                    electronically. These electronic communications may include attempts to collect a debt.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the lender may require you to access documents related to a loan, including your loan
                    contract. By Submitting your Request Form you agree to this form of access.</p>
                <p>The lender may allow you to withdraw your consent to electronic disclosures. Please contact the
                    lender with whom you were connected to learn more about this process. Please note, however, that not
                    consenting to receive electronic disclosures may affect your ability to receive a loan from a Lender
                    Partner.</p>
                <h3>Accuracy</h3>
                <p>You represent that the information you provide to DollarLoanHub.com, and ultimately, the Lender

                <p>This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms as the
                    “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise
                    between you and DollarLoanHub.com, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms (including any
                    alleged breach thereof), the Service, any advertising, or any aspect of the relationship or
                    transactions between us, will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather
                    than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert
                    individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement
                    does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies,
                    and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by
                    entering into these Terms, you and DollarLoanHub.com are each waiving the right to a trial by jury
                    or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a
                    judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
                    Arbitration Agreement.</p>

                    <p> We are always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer
                        concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer support
                        at info@DollarLoanHub.com. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, You and DollarLoanHub.com agree
                        that a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a
                        written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to DollarLoanHub.com should be sent to 3572 W
                        Broadway, Los Angeles, CA 90037, USA (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature
                        and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If
                        DollarLoanHub.com and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the
                        Notice is received, you or DollarLoanHub.com may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the
                        arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by DollarLoanHub.com or you will not be
                        disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which
                        you or DollarLoanHub.com is entitled.</p>

                        and/or arbitral rules, any arbitration between you and US will be conducted by a neutral
                        arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and
                        procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as
                        modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website,
                        http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found
                        at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, https://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any
                        inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the
                        applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines
                        that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a
                        fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as
                        a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the
                        scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration
                        proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings,
                        the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can
                        award to an individual under these Terms and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are
                        enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</p>
                    <p>Unless DollarLoanHub.com and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a
                        reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to
                        travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the
                        determination will be made by AAA or the arbitrator. If your claim is for $10,000 or less,
                        DollarLoanHub.com agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on
                        the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an
                        in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a
                        hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration
                        is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the
                        essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p>
                    <li>Costs of Arbitration</li>
                    <p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”)
                        will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement or
                        the parties entered into a separate agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or
                        less, at your request, DollarLoanHub.com will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief
                        sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are
                        economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise
                        determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration
                        Fees, DollarLoanHub.com will pay your portion of such fees. If you demonstrate to the arbitrator
                        that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation,
                        DollarLoanHub.com will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to
                        prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be
                        governed by the AAA Rules.</p>
                    <li>Confidentiality</li>
                    <p>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator,
                        will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p>
                    <li>Severability</li>
                    <p>If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement
                        (other than the subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and
                        Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such
                        term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest
                        to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
                        Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides
                        that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and
                        Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the
                        entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed
                        to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The
                        remainder of these Terms will continue to apply.</p>
                    <li>Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</li>
                    <p>Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, DollarLoanHub.com agrees that if it
                        makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice
                        Address) while you are a user of the Service, you may reject any such change by sending
                        DollarLoanHub.com written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice
                        Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate
                        any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the
                        date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>

                    closely connects the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms will remain
                    in effect. Any failure by DollarLoanHub.com to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these
                    Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. DollarLoanHub.com may amend these
